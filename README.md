# go
 This is a command line interpreter for navigating directories and to be able to save as bytecode for later use with the respektive virtual machine.

# example

If you are looking to highlight a shell session command sequence as it looks to the user (with prompts, not just as contents of a hypothetical script file), then the right identifier to use at the moment is console:

```console
/Users/philipwenkel/Desktop >> go up
/Users/philipwenkel >> go back
/Users/philipwenkel/Desktop >> go home
/Users/philipwenkel >> set current dirr as gaylord
/Users/philipwenkel/Desktop >> print my nodes
gayloard - /Users/philipwenkel

```
